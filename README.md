# Stat_Methods_Astro
This repo contains statistics tutorials based on the homeworks of the Advanced Statistical Methods for Astrophysics class taught by Prof. John Whelan at RIT. **Feel free to use it for your reference but not as a cheat sheet!**

I hope this repository will be helpful for people who just started learning the often tedious but interesting field of statistics. Below you can find a table of contents for each problem set. Feel free to reach out if you happen to have any questions on the material. I might take some time to reply but will try to do it eventually as I wish to be helpful to any users of this repo. 

## Problem Set 1.
`ps01_vilkha.ipynb` 

* **Probability and Logic** - basic exercises with the logical and, or, not, operations. Union and Intersection. Joint and Conditional Probability Examples.
* **Cumulant Generating Function** - based on Moment Generating Function, worked out to 2nd derivatives.
* **Cauchy Distribution** - change of variables, mean, and probability distribution function.

**WARNING.** If you are pulling the code for the homework submission, I strongly advise to use it just for understanding the problem and writing your own code. Please use this repository as a learning tool, not just copy the code for the homeworks. I can't track how you use it, so I hope you use it responsibly. If copying the code will be the case here, I will have to close the repository to avoid that.

Please comment and collaborate on the project if you have suggestions, have found a way to optimize the problem, or have found a bug in my code.
